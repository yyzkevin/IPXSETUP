NOTES ON -NETS
--------------
By Default ipxsetup will only broadcast game discover packets to your local network.  Once a match is
made each player will transmit unicast packets to each other player, again limited to your local network.

The nets command allows the user to specify additional networks to broadcast/listen on for game discovery.
This does not pose any risk to the network as packets are only broadcast once per second and only during 
matchmaking.  Once a a match is made each player will send unicast packets addressed to the local and/or 
remote players.

To minimize overhead,  the nearest router for each remote network is only discovered once at startup. This
means if your network topology changes during an active game, connectivity may be lost.
